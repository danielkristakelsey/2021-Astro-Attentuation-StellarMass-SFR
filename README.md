# 2021-Astro-Attentuation-StellarMass-SFR
In this study, we investigate the redshift evolution of dust attenuation as a function of star formation rate and stellar mass. Using the 3D-HST photometric catalogues modeled by Prospector, we derive polynomial fits and measure galaxy evolution trends from 0 &lt; z &lt; 3.0 and compare these results to those of similar literature.
